# MNXB11-project-template
# About
This folder contains a skeleton for your project that you can use as
inspiration. Once you get started, do feel free to go ahead and replace this
README file with one representing your project.

# Directory structure

The base directory here contains your "main" file, i.e. the C++ file that you
will be using as your starting point in your project. The code in this file should ideally be short and just make use of the functionality that you've
prepared in your other translation units. The majority of your code should be placed in  the two folders where you define your translation units, `src/` and `include/`. 

Do remember to add your include guards to your header files, otherwise the compiler will
get multiple definitions if you end up loading two source files that include the
same header.

We have also included two special files in the base of the repository 
- [.gitignore](.gitignore): 
- [.clang-format](.clang-format): 

# Building the project

We have included a basic Makefile here which should be familiar to you. It follows the same project structure that we have been using in the course. When you add a new translation unit to the project, you have update the dependencies in the Makefile. 

By default, the `all` target will be run which 
- Compiles any `.cxx` files in the `src/` directory into object files 
- Compiles `main.cxx` and links with all the object files in `src/`

You can run the `clean` target to remove any object files that have been produced as well as the `main` executable.

## Adding external software libraries

If you want to make use of external software libraries with your project, you
will always have to tell the tool that builds your project. The Makefile included in this template will pick up any header files in the external/include directory and look for libraries in external/lib and external/lib64 so if you use external as your installation directory, you only need to add the corresponding `-l` flag to the linker.

Here's an illustration of the typical process to add a (CMake based) external library
``` sh
# Clone or download the library you want to use 
git clone https://somerepository.com/alibrary alibrary # The last argument determines what the directory will be called

mkdir build/alibrary -pv # -p will tell mkdir to create the build/ directory if it doesn't already exist 
# Go into the build directory
cd build/alibrary 
# Look up the documentation for the library to find out if there are any additional flags you need for CMake 

# This command tells CMake to configure the build directory based on the source code in the ../../alibrary folder and to install the resulting headers and library files into ../../external
cmake ../../alibrary -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../external 
# Build and install! Use -jN to launch N jobs
make -j8 install # If you are on an 8-core machine
```


Have fun!
